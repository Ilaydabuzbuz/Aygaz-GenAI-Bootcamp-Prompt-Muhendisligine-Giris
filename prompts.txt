1.Prompt:

Act as a web developer while fulfilling the requests I will list:
Develop me a movie recommendation portfolio website.
The tags I want to have on my website are (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer).
Let the title be "Movie Recommendations".
Let there be a small icon on the left side of the header related to the subject of the website. The title should be positioned immediately to the right.
Make your website compatible with both desktop and mobile.
There should be a subheading that lists 4 types of movie genres. These subheadings: Horror, Comedy, Action, Drama.
The movie genre titles are interactive and when the user clicks on it, 3 movies of that genre, 200x300 in size, can be displayed side by side.
Make sure that the text and photos do not overlap visually.
You can browse the internet and examine similar examples.
Now give me the html, css and javascript codes separately.


2.Prompt:

Instead of displaying the movie names side by side with the format " 'genre' movie" just choose 3 valid movies and display them.
